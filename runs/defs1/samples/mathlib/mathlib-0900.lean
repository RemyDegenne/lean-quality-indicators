/-- An `AddTorsor G P` gives a structure to the nonempty type `P`,
acted on by an `AddGroup G` with a transitive and free action given
by the `+ᵥ` operation and a corresponding subtraction given by the
`-ᵥ` operation. In the case of a vector space, it is an affine
space. -/
class AddTorsor (G : outParam Type*) (P : Type*) [AddGroup G] extends AddAction G P,
  VSub G P where
  [nonempty : Nonempty P]
  /-- Torsor subtraction and addition with the same element cancels out. -/
